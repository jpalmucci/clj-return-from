# clj-return-from

An implementation of common lisp's return-from for clojure

## Usage

The 'block' macro will establish a block with lexical scope. In this
lexical scope, a return-from-<blockname> macro can be used to
immediately exit the block with some return value.

EX:

(block foo
       (+ 1 2))

==> 3

(block foo
       (return-from-foo :bar)
       (+ 1 2))

==> :bar

Note: If you attempt to return-from a block on a different thread
than the one that established the block, you will get a runtime error.

To install, add:

:dependencies [[clj-return-from "1.0.0"]]

to your project.clj file. The code is hosted on clojars.
