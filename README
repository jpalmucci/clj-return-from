# clj-return-from

An implementation of common lisp's return-from for clojure

## Usage

The 'block' macro will establish a block with lexical scope. In this
lexical scope, a return-from-<blockname> macro can be used to
immediately exit the block with some return value.

EX:

(block foo
       (+ 1 2))

==> 3

(block foo
       (return-from-foo :bar)
       (+ 1 2))

==> :bar
